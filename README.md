# 👋 Hi, I’m Adrián

I love turning ambitious product ideas into reliable, cloud-native systems that serve your needs. My day‑to‑day revolves around:

* **Serverless & event‑driven design** – architecting and building low‑latency, auto‑scaling services within AWS.
* **Golden‑path tooling** – creating reusable libraries, CI/CD pipelines and guardrails that let teams ship faster with fewer mistakes.
* **Product‑first thinking** – digging into real user pain points, shaping clear technical roadmaps and measuring impact against business goals.
* **Hands‑on leadership** – guiding cross‑functional squads, mentoring engineers and fostering a culture where diverse ideas thrive.

I’m also the author of [pydamodb](https://github.com/adriantomas/pydamodb), a lightweight Pydantic ODM that makes working with Amazon DynamoDB more straightforward. Feel free to explore the repo, star it, or raise an issue if you have ideas for improvement.

*“Great products start with great problems.”* 🚀
