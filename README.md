# 👋 Hi, I’m Adrián

I love turning ambitious product ideas into reliable, cloud-native systems designed to stay out of the way so teams can ship fast. My day‑to‑day revolves around:

* **Serverless & event‑driven design** – architecting and building low‑latency, auto‑scaling services within AWS.
* **Developer tooling** – creating reusable libraries, CI/CD pipelines and guardrails that let teams ship faster with less friction.
* **Product engineering** – digging into real user pain points, shaping clear technical roadmaps and measuring impact against business goals.
* **Hands‑on leadership** – guiding cross‑functional squads, mentoring engineers and fostering a culture where diverse ideas thrive.

I’m also the author of:

* [pydamodb](https://github.com/adriantomas/pydamodb), a lightweight Pydantic ODM for Amazon DynamoDB. One-line CRUD with type safety and zero boilerplate.
* [boto3-errors](https://github.com/adriantomas/boto3-errors) – Typed, statically-importable exception classes for every AWS service. No more string-parsing `ClientError` or needing a client instance to catch specific errors.

Feel free to explore, ⭐️, or open an issue.
